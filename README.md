# Red-wine-Quality
This project predicts red wine quality using machine learning. The dataset, with physicochemical properties of wines, is preprocessed in Python to handle missing values, visualize data, and normalize features. Various models, including Random Forest and SVC, are trained to classify wine quality, aiding data-driven decision-making.
