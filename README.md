# Red-wine-Quality
This project uses machine learning to predict red wine quality based on physicochemical attributes. Data is carefully cleaned, visualized, and preprocessed to ensure reliability for modeling. Several classification models, including Random Forest and KNN, are trained and evaluated using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices. The results demonstrate the value of data-driven approaches in supporting quality control and production decisions within the wine industry.
